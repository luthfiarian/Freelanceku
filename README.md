You don‚Äôt have to worry about your money being deposited on the platform, because you can withdraw it anytime to your bank account. You can also see your transaction history easily and transparently. <strong>Freelanceku</strong> is a web application that is suitable for you who want to work flexibly and not binding, and expand your network and experience.
